        everybody, Corner House celebrates the spirit of old Bangalore. To this day, it remains steeped in that uniquely Bangalore feeling.
        Over the last (almost) four decades Corner House has seen birthdays, graduations, first dates, family get-togethers, and even a few engagements.
        Being a part of these memories has only proved that the purpose of the brand goes beyond just dessert.
        Nostalgia is a powerful emotion, and one closely associated with Corner House.
        We take pride in being truly Bangalorean.
        It is the simple moments, the easy interactions and the memories that make up our most essential values.
        Our purpose is to serve uncompromised, quality desserts consistently, and to take care of the people who make the business: our patrons and employees.
        In other words, customers get their moneyâ€™s worth.
        The system followed at our outlets is self-service, but the company strives to take care of its customers in every way possible.
        Processes have been put in place to maintain consistency for every customer order.
        Employees at Corner House are a priority. Aside from the mandatory ESI, employees are provided additional private insurance to cover minor ailments that
        may not be within the purview of the ESI.
        Employees also benefit from good quality food provided for all three meals, as well as accommodation near the workplace.
        Through the months of the Covid-19 pandemic, employees have been given access to nutritional supplementation in the form of vitamins and medication to boost
        their immunity.""")
